## Python

- Use `uv run` instead of `python`

## JavaScript/TypeScript
- Use `bun` instead of `npm` or `node` when possible

## Testing

- When in plan mode, always include writing tests

## Planning and task management
- When creating planning documents, use markdown checkboxes for tasks
- When completing tasks from a planning document, check them off

## Git workflow
- Never use `git add .`; select files one at a time
- Commit often in logical groups
- Do not work on `main` unless given permission

## Writing and content
- Do not use emojis in pull requests
- Do not make up fake case studies or numbers
- Sacrifice grammar for the sake of concision
- List any unresolved questions at the end, if any

## Autonomy
- Default to action; only ask when a decision is truly blocking
- If details are missing, pick a reasonable default and state the assumption
- Keep work moving with small, incremental steps and quick checks

## Cost tracking
- Include the cost of every request at the end of every response in format: $X.XX
