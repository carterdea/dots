- "Why it matters" context immediately after.
- Bullets for important data points or supporting ideas.
- Bold any words, figures, or names you want to stand out.
- Clean, intuitive visuals to amplify important points.

## Newsletter
- Come up with a 1-2 word punchy name.
- Specify read time up top (avg person reads ~265 words/min).
- First item: "1 big thing" with a tight, forceful headline.
- Number items. 5-10 items ideal.
- Total length: under 1,200 words (under 1,000 ideal).
- Each item: 200 words max.
- End with something funny or personal ("1 fun thing").
- Font, text size, and layout must be pleasing to the eye.
- Every item must be truly essential.

## Presentation / PowerPoint
- Start with your big idea distilled to ~6 words.
- One message per slide. Absorb the point in 3 seconds max (billboard test).
- 20 words max per slide.
- Pictures are exponentially more effective than text clumps.
- One font, one visual style.
- 5-6 slides max (rarely exceed this).
- End where you began: restate your Big Idea. Then stop.
- "For every 20 slides you want, use 2." — McKinsey partner rule.
- Final slide: "I called this meeting so I can get ______."

## Speech / Talk
- Win before you begin: be authentic, be yourself.
- No slides, notes, or teleprompters if possible.
- Start with a real-life story ending with a chuckle (keep it short—neighbor test).
- Distill your Big Thought to one SHORT sentence (15 words max, shorter is better).
- Open with: "The one thing I want you to remember today is..."
- Follow with verbal "Why it matters."
- Unfurl 2-5 stats or stories to back up the Big Thought. Number them.
- Reinforce at end: "Remember, if there is one thing you take away..."
- Say thank you. Always end on a gracious note.
- Sweet spot: 18 minutes or less (TED Talk standard).

## Social Media

### Twitter
- Likes: facts, data, hot quotes, news breaks. The more urgent, the better.
- Give something to the audience (idea, score, laugh) rather than asking them to click/buy.
- One thing only. Tease with a newsy nugget, provocative quote, or memorable data point.
- Clean, simple, arresting images.

### Instagram
- Eye-catching image + slim, muscular text.
- Since you often can't link out, boil it down completely.
- Changing: more news and information, less filtered photos.

### Facebook
- Provocative spin on your idea or announcement.
- If it's a snore, it'll vanish under the News Feed.
- Hot takes get action and traction.

### General Social Rules
- Strong, simple words + evocative emojis.
- Pick clean, simple, arresting images.
- Words without art are a loser everywhere.

## Meetings
### Before
- Make sure you truly need a meeting.
- Set objective (one direct sentence) and agenda (3 bullet points max) in an email before.
- Send the night before. Outline specific decisions/actions.

### During
- Set time limit: 20 minutes is usually sufficient. Test micro-meetings (5-10 min).
- Open with headline: one-sentence objective.
- Second sentence: "Why it matters" to this group at this moment.
- State unambiguously what decisions need to be made.
- Guide discussion. Interrupt tangents with a smile: "Off-topic!"
- Be inclusive. Encourage quiet people to share.
- 2 minutes left: summarize takeaways, specific next steps.

### After
- Shoot the group a quick email with bullet-pointed follow-ups.
- These often prompt additions, saving another meeting.

## Visuals / Design
- Elegant efficiency: cleanest, sharpest, most pleasing display.
- Establish hierarchy: scale, color, contrast to guide the viewer's eye.
- Does the concept make sense to fresh eyes?
- Are all elements legible?
- Start with a strong concept.
- Edit out superfluous elements.
- Judge from the viewer's perspective.
- Good hierarchy goes unnoticed. Poor hierarchy draws unwanted attention.

## Workplace Communication
- Write essential updates in Smart Brevity.
- Send weekly updates via newsletters. Sunday or early Monday works best.
- Morning sends maximize open rates.
- Encourage direct reports to do the same.
- These updates become a living library of strategic decisions.

## Inclusive Writing
- Write in plain, clear language.
- Use bullet points to separate key points.
- Keep it simple and short: complexity confuses, abstraction alienates, length loses.
- Be specific when writing about someone—ask how they identify.
- Cut descriptors that reinforce stereotypes.
- Swap one identity for another to check if language remains nonjudgmental.
- Omit irrelevant demographic information.
- Refer to a disability only when relevant.
