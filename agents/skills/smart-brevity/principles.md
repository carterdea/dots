# Smart Brevity: Core Principles

## The Problem

- People spend 26 seconds on average reading a piece of content.
- Most people spend fewer than 15 seconds on web pages they click.
- One-third of work emails requiring attention go unread.
- Most words of most news stories are never seen.
- People check their phones 344+ times per day.
- People scan, not read, almost everything on screens.
- It takes 20+ minutes to refocus after a distraction.

## The Core 4 Structure

Every Smart Brevity communication has four parts:

### 1. Muscular Tease (Headline / Subject Line)
- 6 or fewer strong words.
- Yank attention away from everything else.
- No cleverness, irony, or cryptic language.
- No fancy SAT words or business-speak.
- One-syllable words are strongest.
- Active verbs always.
- Ask: Would you read it if you hadn't written it?

### 2. One Strong First Sentence (The Lede)
- The most memorable sentence in the piece.
- Tell the reader something they don't know, would want to know, should know.
- As direct, short, and sharp as possible.
- One sentence only. No anecdotes, jokes, or showing off.
- If this is the ONLY thing someone sees, it should be exactly what you want to stick.
- Hack: Tell someone what happened out loud. That's your first sentence.

### 3. Context (Why It Matters)
- Bold the words "Why it matters" (or another Axiom).
- In one sentence (two max), explain why the information in your first sentence is important.
- What will it change? What does it signal? What's the larger context?
- Should NOT be redundant with your opening sentence.
- Should add perspective.

### 4. The Choice to Learn More (Go Deeper)
- Don't force someone to read more than they want.
- Make it their decision.
- Link to source material, video, podcast, bio, map, etc.
- Most won't click, but seeing the option builds trust and shows thoroughness.

## Axioms (Signposts)

Bold signposts that guide skimmers. The most effective:

- **Why it matters** (most common and effective)
- **The big picture**
- **What's next**
- **What we're watching / hearing**
- **Between the lines**
- **The backstory**
- **Catch up quick**
- **Zoom in / Zoom out**
- **By the numbers**
- **The bottom line**
- **Reality check**
- **What's happening**
- **The other side**

Weak framing vs. strong Axioms:
- "Here's what's important to know" → **Why it matters**
- "A trend we've been observing" → **The big picture**
- "Let's take a look at the data" → **By the numbers**
- "In conclusion" → **The bottom line**

## Word Choice Rules

### Strong Words
- One-syllable words are more powerful than two-syllable, which are more powerful than three.
- Strong words are vivid, precise, and something you can see, touch, taste, photograph.
- Strong nouns: fire, boat, cage, cliff, fish.
- Strong verbs: chop, taunt, botch, crush.
- Subject. Verb. Object. Linear, not twisty.

### Weak Words to Purge
Fancy/spelling-bee words (replace with simpler alternative):
- vociferous → vocal
- prevaricate → lie
- didactic → preachy
- conundrum → jam
- paradox → puzzle
- disconcerting → bad
- salient → on-point
- conclave → meeting
- vicissitude → change
- quintessential → classic
- breadth → range
- verisimilitude → real
- elucidate → explain

Journalese/academic words:
- discourse → talk
- challenge → problem
- posit → assume
- dearth → lack
- paucity → scarcity
- obfuscate → hide
- ubiquitous → everywhere
- veracity → truth
- altercation → fight
- vehement → forceful
- disseminate → spread
- raison d'être → purpose

### Foggy Words to Avoid
- "could," "may," "might" — tell nothing. Say what IS happening.
- Replace with: "planned," "considered," "discussed," "feared," "hoped," "expected."

### Active vs. Passive Voice
- Active: "The Taliban captured Afghanistan."
- Passive: "The situation in Afghanistan continues to deteriorate from a security perspective."
- Formula: Who — doing — what.
- Tell a story. Don't tell about a story.

### Strong Phrases
Short, crisp, punchy = memorable, clear, smart.
- "Jesus wept." (9 letters, one vivid verse)
- Japan surrenders.
- Sales cratered.
- Revenue boomed.
- I quit.

## Formatting Rules

### Bullets
- Use bullets when presenting 3+ data points or related ideas.
- Nobody wants to stare at a clump of words.
- People skim nicely separated, bulleted points.
- Bullets should be at least 1-2 sentences unless brevity demands otherwise.

### Bold
- Bold Axioms and specific words/figures you want to stand out.
- Darker and more detectable than italics.
- Screams "Pay attention to this!"

### Paragraphs
- Two or three sentences max per paragraph.
- Avoid long blocks of consecutive paragraphs.
- Mix: bolding, bullets, charts, Axioms to break up flow.

### Length Targets
- Newsletter items: 200 words max per item.
- Total newsletter: under 1,200 words (under 1,000 ideal).
- Slides: 20 words max.
- Subject lines: 6 words.
- Headlines: 6 words.
- Big thought in a speech: 15 words max (shorter is better).

## The Audience-First Principle

- Think about serving your audience first, not your ego.
- Picture the specific person you're trying to reach.
- Figure out what you want that person to remember specifically.
- Find taut, vivid, memorable ways to express it.
- Test: Ask a friend to read it, then tell you the one big idea. If they can't, rewrite.
- The easiest way to get across what you're trying to say is... just say it. Then stop.

## The Deletion Principle

- Delete, delete, delete.
- Every word or sentence you shave saves the other person time.
- If you don't know what you want to say, you paper over it by saying too much.
- The most useful communication is often silence.
- "Brevity is confidence. Length is fear."

## Anti-Patterns (What NOT to Do)

- Don't fake depth with length.
- Don't start with apologies, throat-clearing, or preamble.
- Don't repeat the tease/headline verbatim in the first sentence.
- Don't use passive voice.
- Don't hide the point in the middle or end.
- Don't use jargon or business-speak.
- Don't assume the reader will find the important part themselves.
- Don't say "price point" when you mean "price."
- Don't say "core competency" when you mean "skill."
- Cowards hide in clauses.
